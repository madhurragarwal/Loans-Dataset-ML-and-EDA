# Decision Tree and Random Forest Project with EDA

## Project Overview
This repository contains a project focused on building decision tree and random forest models for loan prediction using a loans dataset. The dataset has undergone Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data before model development.

## Dataset
1. Dataset Name: loans.csv
2. Data Source: Kaggle
3. Data Description: The Dataset has multiple columns related to the Loans approved, rejected, paid back or missed out payments.
   
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before developing predictive models, we conducted EDA to better understand the dataset. Some key findings from EDA include:
- Distribution of loan approval status.
- Summary statistics of numerical features.
- Visualization of feature distributions.
- Correlation analysis to identify feature relationships.

## Model Building
In this project, we have developed two types of models:
1. **Decision Tree Model**: This model uses a single decision tree to make loan approval predictions.
2. **Random Forest Model**: Random forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
